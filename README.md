## Code of Conduct

All the code of conduct says is that the work environment will be harrassment free. All commitments done by each member will be done assuming 
they follow each of the assumed rules. These rules are to not judge people based on who they are as people. In laments terms, be a genuine, nice 
person in the work environment. If these rules are broken, it will result in a warning, eventually leading to a permenant ban from working within 
this community.
