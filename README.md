## Our Program
---
The program takes input from the user, getting their name and age. After, it will use that information and greet the user.

## Code
---
```python
name = input("What is your name?") #User input for the name 
age = int(input("What is your age: ")) #User input for the age

#This will greet the user, saying hello to them and telling them their age
print("Hello {}, you are {} years old").format(name, age)
```
